# NixOS Config (or something like that)

This is my personal NixOS config.
As you might notice, I dho't really know what I do here. I love and hate NixOS but as I use it more often, I start to get used to it.
I'm still really new to NixOS and software development in general, so consider this a learning project and work in progress.

## Notes

This config is constantly evolving as I learn more.
Any feedback or suggestions are very welcome!
